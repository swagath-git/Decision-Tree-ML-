# Decision Tree Classifier – Machine Learning Project
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier using Python’s scikit-learn library. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
The project is beginner-friendly and provides a clear understanding of how decision trees work in supervised machine learning for both classification and feature importance analysis.

# Technologies Used  
  1. Python
  2. Jupyter Notebook
  3. Pandas, NumPy – for data handling and analysis
  4. Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating the Decision Tree model
  5. Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization

# Project Workflow
# Importing Libraries
  1. Import all essential Python libraries required for analysis, visualization, and model building.

# Loading and Exploring Data
  1. Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
  2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.

# Data Preprocessing
  1. Handle missing values.
  2. Encode categorical variables if any.
  3. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).

# Results

  1. Identified key features that impact prediction.
  2. Optimized model through parameter tuning.
  3. Achieved high accuracy and interpretability.
